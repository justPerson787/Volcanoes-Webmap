## About Project

This is a web map depicting volcanoes in the US.
To create the map I used python, folium and pandas (to load csv file with data).

The project has been created with the help of the Udemy python course  https://www.udemy.com/the-python-mega-course.

## Features
The web map has following features:

- markers of different color depending on volcanoes height;
- a pop-up window to turn the layer of markers off and on.
